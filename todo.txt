Approach 1:

    Tasks
        Download a youtube video in FS
            - read the docs 
        Convert into mp3
            - u have the script but again find a method to download the mp3 into file system
        store in DB
            - store song url in DB
        And fetch next time
            - pull whenever needed ^_^

    Bs: (MVP)
        store youtube URL, store Thumbnail Image, store the user creds

    Outcome: 
        turns out, it is illegal to convert a youtube video to mp3, now what?

Approach 2:

    Tasks
        Upload a normal mp3 file from the User into the DB
    
        Play from anywhere, i think that's it ...
