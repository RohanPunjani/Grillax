# Grillax

Grillax is an online music player which lets you listen to music with amazing UI and pure ajax calls in php.

# Things I learned

1. Making UI is soo fun
2. Handling Javascript objects and interacting with them is always something new!
3. Fetching JSON objects using ajax api calls and refreshing the data on the subscription basis is never boring
4. Successfully hosting a PHP web-app xD

Here is a small preview of the project =>

The project is not yet complete but I have stopped maintaining the project, \
The codebase is fairly simple and everything is done by making ajax api calls in the realtime basis
